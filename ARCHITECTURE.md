# Autonomous Development Team Architecture

## System Overview

The Autonomous Development Team is a distributed system of AI agents that collaborate to complete software development projects without human intervention. The system is built on a microservices architecture with event-driven communication.

## Core Components

### 1. Orchestrator (`orchestration/orchestrator.py`)
The central coordinator that manages all agents and system resources.

**Responsibilities:**
- Agent lifecycle management (spawning, monitoring, termination)
- Task distribution and assignment
- Resource allocation and load balancing
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Agent recruitment based on workload
- System health monitoring

**Key Methods:**
- `spawn_agent()` - Creates new agent instances
- `assign_task_to_agent()` - Routes tasks to appropriate agents
- `handle_assistance_request()` - Coordinates inter-agent help
- `monitor_agent_health()` - Tracks agent status and performance

### 2. Message Broker (`communication/message_broker.py`)
Redis-based communication layer enabling asynchronous message passing between agents.

**Features:**
- Publish/subscribe messaging patterns
- Request-response communication
- Message persistence and history
- Broadcast capabilities
- Task queue management
- Agent registration and discovery

**Message Types:**
- `task_assignment` - Task delegation to agents
- `task_completed` - Task completion notifications
- `assistance_request` - Inter-agent collaboration requests
- `status_update` - Agent health and status reports
- `progress_report` - Project progress updates

### 3. Base Agent (`core/base_agent.py`)
Abstract base class defining the common interface and functionality for all agent types.

**Core Features:**
- LLM integration (Ollama client)
- Context memory management
- Message handling infrastructure
- Task execution framework
- Error handling and retry logic
- Performance metrics collection

**Agent Lifecycle:**
1. **Initialization** - Setup LLM client, register capabilities
2. **Registration** - Connect to message broker, join team

## Communication Patterns

### 1. Task Assignment Flow
```
Orchestrator → Message Broker → Agent
             ↓
    Task Queue (if agent busy)
             ↓
    Agent (when available)
```

### 2. Inter-Agent Collaboration
```
Agent A → Assistance Request → Orchestrator
                             ↓
        Agent B ← Task Assignment ← Orchestrator
                             ↓
        Agent A ← Response ← Agent B
```

### 3. Status Reporting
```
All Agents → Status Updates → Orchestrator
                           ↓
           Metrics Collection & Analysis
                           ↓
           Dashboard & Monitoring
```

## Data Flow

### 1. Project Initialization
1. User submits project requirements
2. Project Manager breaks down into tasks
3. Tasks are prioritized and assigned to sprint backlog
4. Orchestrator distributes tasks based on agent capabilities
5. Agents begin execution in parallel

### 2. Task Execution
1. Agent receives task assignment
2. Agent analyzes requirements and context
3. Agent generates LLM prompts and processes responses
4. Agent executes implementation or deliverable
5. Agent validates results and handles errors
6. Agent reports completion with artifacts

### 3. Collaboration Workflow
1. Agent identifies need for assistance
2. Agent requests help specifying required capability
3. Orchestrator finds suitable helper agent
4. Helper agent provides assistance
5. Original agent integrates help and continues
6. Results are shared with team for learning

## Scalability Architecture

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Agent Pool Management**: Dynamic spawning of additional agents based on workload
- **Load Distribution**: Intelligent task assignment considering agent capacity
- **Resource Optimization**: Automatic agent termination when demand decreases

### Vertical Scaling
- **Model Selection**: Appropriate LLM models for different agent types
- **Context Management**: Efficient memory usage with sliding window context
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics for optimization decisions

## Technology Stack

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- **Local Processing**: All LLM inference happens locally via Ollama
- **Memory Isolation**: Agent contexts are isolated and protected
- **Secure Communication**: Redis AUTH and encryption support
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic models validate all data structures

### Access Control
- **Agent Authentication**: Each agent has unique identity and capabilities
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and execution time constraints
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Agent code execution in controlled environments
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all agent actions

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection
- Task completion rates and execution times
- Agent utilization and performance statistics  
- System resource usage and bottlenecks
- Error rates and failure patterns
- Inter-agent collaboration frequency

### Health Monitoring
- Agent heartbeat and liveness checks
- Message broker connectivity status
- LLM service availability and response times
- Resource exhaustion warnings
- Automatic recovery and restart procedures

### Performance Analytics
- Sprint velocity and predictability
- Code quality metrics and technical debt
- Test coverage and defect detection rates
- User satisfaction and requirement fulfillment
- System scalability and efficiency metrics

## Extension Points

### Custom Communication Patterns
1. Define new message types in message broker
